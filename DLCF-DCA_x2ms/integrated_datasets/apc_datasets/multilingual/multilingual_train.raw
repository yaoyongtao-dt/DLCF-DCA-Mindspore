went here w/ great expectations and was greatly disappointed; the $T$ was good, not great and vastly overpriced- one salad, two pasta dishes, two demi-carafes of red wine- $100 (tax and tip); rediculous; orechiette came w/ so little brocoli rape that it did not have its characteristic flavor; and it is very very loud.

Everything on the $T$ is worth trying at least once, from the calamari/zucchini appetizer, to the homemade cavatelli, to the rib eye steak (like butter!)

The $75 tasting $T$ features seafood which is both unusual and powerfully fresh, but the chef's appetizers which preceed it like sesame flavored tile fish with raw vegetable salad and japanese spiced flan with seafood were unbalanced and far too delicate on the palate (although the tuna tartare with avocado is a standout).
